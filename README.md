# PropertyGuru-Scraper
This is a scraper that I built to extract residential apartment and condos properties for sale in Kuala Lumpur.

There are two parts to the project:
1. Web scraper
2. Dashboard

The goal is to identify undervalued properties on sale.

This project is done for educational purposes only.

## Installation
The scraper was built using BeautifulSoup4. 
The dashboard was built using Streamlit.

To use, make sure to have all the dependencies installed. 

You may download the [requirements.txt (for scraper)](https://github.com/Cezska/PropertyGuru-Scraper/blob/669f76bff3a5cdeeaddefbd11fa2bac2ed1b5274/propertyguru_scraper/requirements.txt) or [requirements.txt (for dashboard)](https://github.com/Cezska/PropertyGuru-Scraper/blob/669f76bff3a5cdeeaddefbd11fa2bac2ed1b5274/propertyguru_scraper/requirements.txt](https://github.com/Cezska/PropertyGuru-Scraper/blob/669f76bff3a5cdeeaddefbd11fa2bac2ed1b5274/streamlit_dashboard/requirements.txt)https://github.com/Cezska/PropertyGuru-Scraper/blob/669f76bff3a5cdeeaddefbd11fa2bac2ed1b5274/streamlit_dashboard/requirements.txt) and run the following

Pip:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Conda:

```conda install --file requirements.txt```

## Web scraper
The scraper by default is fitted with a URL from PropertyGuru. The URL has existing filter for `Apartment/Condo/Serviced Residence` and `Kuala Lumpur` listings. Therefore, only listings that meets the two criterias would be scraped.

Output will be saved in a CSV under `data` folder.

`full_address`, `latitude` and `longitude` columns are data obtained through geocoding of the title+location of the listing. Geocoding is done via Google Maps.

### Usage
Do fill in the parameters at the top of the script as your need.
Do ensure the URLs on three sections are updated accordingly.
1. Parameters section (first page/beginning page of the listing directory to scrape from)
2. scrape_listing function (has to match #1)
3. listing_areas function (only change this to match the area in #1 & #2 if you're scraping area other than Kuala Lumpur otherwise may leave as is)

## Dashboard
The dashboard is built and hosted on Streamlit [here](https://propertyguru-scraper-project.streamlit.app/).

There are two main sections to the dashboard:
1) Analytics and/or general summary of the scraped listings
2) A map plotted with all the scraped listings
